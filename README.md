# My LeetCode Solution Examples

Many posted solutions on leetcode are with improper style or logic, making them less readable.

This repo is a collection of some of my leetcode solutions. They will
* follow the Google Java Coding style guide (yes, indentation +2 spaces);
* be optimal solutions;
* be easy to read with clear logic.

## Highlited Solutions

- ### BinarySearch/BinarySearch.java

- I included four ways to write binary search on a sorted array, and I consider that these four ways are "Design Pattern" for most of the binary search problems, such as first occurrence, last occurrence, first smallest larger than target, last largest smaller than target...

- ### DFS/JumpGameIII.java

- One of my favorite solutions! In general, it needs a boolean[] to record what elements has been visited, but I recorded the visited elements by making it negative instead of using a boolean[] array. Since the DFS needs to add and minus current element, so its mathematical symbol (+ or -) doesn't matter!
